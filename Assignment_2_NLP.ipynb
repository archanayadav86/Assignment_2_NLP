    "Ans-->A corpus is a large and structured set of machine-readable texts that have been produced in a natural communicative setting. Its plural is corpora. They can be derived in different ways like text that was originally electronic, transcripts of spoken language and optical character recognition, etc. There are many different kinds of corpora. They can contain written or spoken (transcribed) language, modern or old texts, texts from one language or several languages. The texts can be whole books, newspapers, journals, speeches etc, or consist of extracts of varying length."

A type is the class of all tokens containing the same character sequence. A term is a (perhaps normalized) type that is included in the IR system's dictionary."

    "Ans-->Lemmatization is the process of grouping together different inflected forms of the same word. It's used in computational linguistics, natural language processing (NLP) and chatbots. It is the context and converts the word to its meaningful base form, which is called Lemma. For instance, stemming the word 'Caring' would return 'Car'. For instance, lemmatizing the word 'Caring' would return 'Care'"

    "Ans-->Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form—generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. "

   "source": [
    "Ans-->Shallow parsing (also chunking or light parsing) is an analysis of a sentence which first identifies constituent parts of sentences (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) and then links them to higher order units that have discrete grammatical meanings (noun groups or phrases, verb groups, etc.).Chunking is a process of extracting phrases from unstructured text, which means analyzing a sentence to identify the constituents(Noun Groups, Verbs, verb groups, etc.) However, it does not specify their internal structure, nor their role in the main sentence. It works on top of POS tagging.A chunk structure is a two-level tree that spans the entire text, and. contains both chunks and un-chunked tokens."

    "Ans-->Chunking is defined as the process of natural language processing used to identify parts of speech and short phrases present in a given sentence.One of the main goals of chunking is to group into what are known as \"noun phrases.\" These are phrases of one or more words that contain a noun, maybe some descriptive words, maybe a verb, and maybe something like an adverb. The idea is to group nouns with the words that are in relation to them."
